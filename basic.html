<div class="">
 <h2>Design is Everywhere</h2>
 <p>Every human-made entity is a product of design, even if that design is unfinished, undocumented, or unacknowledged. 
     Databases, building layouts, medical devices, video game UIs, military equipment&mdash;all these and more are the result of design processes, 
     and should be considered as such.</p>
</div>

<div class="">
    <h2>Design has Context</h2>
    <p>Designed objects are made by a specific person or group, and exist in the world with other people and groups.
        Designers must be aware of their own positionality and the perspectives of all those affected by their output.</p>
    <p>Always ask: Who benefits from this design? Who is at risk? Who has been consulted, and who has been
        excluded?</p>
    <p>Design is created in a particular time, space, and culture. Design that is “neutral” to these aspects is a
        logical impossibility.</p>
</div>


<div class="">
    <h2>Design is Playful</h2>
    <p>Limitless, blue-sky ideation is invaluable. Leave room to dream.</p>
    <p>Design is a valuable way to challenge our own assumptions, and to push others to see the world in a new
        way.</p>
</div>

<div class="">
    <h2>Design has Impact</h2>
    <p>Design embodies and animates our spoken and unspoken values. Designers must be prepared to articulate
        and defend their beliefs.</p>
    <p>Our world is shaped by what we create. To design ethically, our creations must logically lead to a better
        world.</p>
