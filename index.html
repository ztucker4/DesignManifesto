<h1>Design Manifesto</h1>
<p>This manifesto was created by Zo&euml; Tucker for IS 272: Human-Computer Interaction, Spring 2022 at UCLA.</p>
<p>This is the "fancy" version of the page. Click on the section titles to expand and collapse them. Opening them multiple times may reveal changes.</p>
<p><a href="basic.html">Click here for the basic/unstyled version.</a></p>


<button type="button" class="collapsible" id="everywhere">Design is Everywhere</button>
<div class="content" id="examples">
    <p>Every human-made entity is a product of design, even if that design is unfinished, undocumented, or unacknowledged.</p> 
    <p>Databases, building layouts, medical devices, video game UIs, military equipment&mdash;all these and more are the result of design processes, 
        and should be considered as such.</p>
</div> 

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Design has Context</button>
<div class="content">
    <p>Designed objects are made by a specific person or group, and exist in the world with other people and groups.
        Designers must be aware of their own positionality and the perspectives of all those affected by their output.</p>
    <p>Always ask: Who benefits from this design? Who is at risk? Who has been consulted, and who has been
        excluded?</p>
    <p>Design is created in a particular time, space, and culture. Design that is “neutral” to these aspects is a
        logical impossibility.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" id="genNew" class="collapsible">Design is Playful</button>
<div class="content" id = "playful">
    <p>Limitless, blue-sky ideation is invaluable. Leave room to dream.</p>
    <p>Design is a valuable way to challenge our own assumptions, and to push others to see the world in a new
        way.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Design has Impact</button>
<div class="content">
    <p>Design embodies and animates our spoken and unspoken values. Designers must be prepared to articulate
        and defend their beliefs.</p>
    <p>Our world is shaped by what we create. To design ethically, our creations must logically lead to a better
        world.</p>
</div>
